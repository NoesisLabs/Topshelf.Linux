Topshelf.Linux
==============

Topshelf extensions allowing compatibility with mono/linux.

This is mostly a Work-In-Progress which I will try to get merged into Topshelf
once it is somewhat complete and working on a few different linux distros.

Right now it allows running Topshelf based services from command line and or 
rc-scripts, while using the same binaries on Windows/MS.NET w/o requiring any 
changes.
